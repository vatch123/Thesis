This chapter provides a brief summary of the Application layer which forms an integral part of the TCP/IP and OSI networks models. This chapter also discusses the need of application layer coding and basic description of some schemes already in use. In the latter sections, we also discuss our use case along with a description of a previous works already done in this area.

\section{Application Layer}
\rhead{Application Layer}

The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the Internet Protocol (IP) form the backbone of today's internet and other data communication methods. They are collection of protocols that define how the data is to be packetized, framed, addressed, transmitted, routed and received. All of these various functions are abstracted through various layers each having a specific function. The TCP/IP protocol suite has five layers and application layer is one of them.

Application Layer is present at the top of the TCP/IP and OSI models. It is through this layer that a user interacts with the system. It also provides services and interfaces which ensures that an application can communicate with any other application on the same network. Though the name states ``Application Layer'', it should not be thought of a software application rather it is a component of the application which allows it to communicate to other applications on the network through the various lower layers of TCP/IP protocol. It serves to abstract the messy inner steps involved with the lower layers during data communication or transfer. Figure \ref{fig-1.1} shows the various layers involved in the TCP/IP protocol. The application layer protocols provides various functions:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Identification of Communicating Nodes:} The application layer decides the availability of a node for an application with data to transmit.
	\item \textbf{Resource availability:} It also decides whether the amount of network resources required for any communication are available.
	\item \textbf{Synchronization:} It make sures that applications communicating with each other are in sync.
\end{itemize}

\section{Problem Formulation and Motivation}
\rhead{Problem Formulation and Motivation}
Many wireless networks operate in certain in frequency band where they are subjected to various duty cycle constraints. Moreover, the current trend of building connected devices or systems has made it necessary for using many sensor nodes transmitting data to a receiver for further processing and decision making. So these duty cycle constraints limit the ability of the receiver to transmit feedback about the reception of packets back to the sensors. In a similar fashion, the sensor nodes themselves can only make a limited number of retransmissions for erasure correction. Now, the task of designing an efficient application layer coding scheme which can used in the above scenario becomes challenging, but, if the use cases are delay sensitive then it becomes further complicated. In such a scenario, one data packet generated at the source is of value to receiver only for a certain time frame and after passage of that threshold it becomes useless. Examples of such networks can be found in sensor networks in industries which monitor and control various processes in a plant and where most decisions are made in real-time.

In this thesis, the focus is on a duty cycle and feedback constrained delay sensitive multipoint to point communication. The work is based on creating modifications to an existing coding technique \cite{borkotokyicc}. In our use case, the data generated is valid for a fixed time interval, after which its importance cease to exist. All transmission made by the sensor node can be a uncoded packet (pure information packet or message) or a coded message (a data packet formed by linear combination of two or more messages). Since most sensor are low-powered devices we aim to develop a coding scheme which is computationally cheap and avoids coding packets unless absolutely necessary. The feedback structure of the system is also designed in a way such that maximum information about the receiver state can be transmitted back to the receiver. The design also makes sure that even if feedback is missing coding is done effectively to ensure better packet reception. We limit our design to GF(2) where coding is done by simply XORing two symbols to avoid complex coding schemes in higher order fields.

\section{Literature Survey}
\label{LiteratureSurvey}
\rhead{Literature Survey}
LT codes \cite{ltcode} and Raptor Codes \cite{raptor} have been used widely due to their strong erasure correction. They operate over a large set of symbols which translates to higher decoding delays. This delay makes them useless for delay-constraints applications. \cite{DRINEA2013100} attempts a coding scheme with smaller blocks of information symbols. They investigate the effectiveness of their approach for networks where a number of senders transmits to a single receiver over an erasure channel but with perfect feedback. They account for the delay constraints but fail to acknowledge the duty cycle constraint in our case. Later,\cite{Fong} introduced a new network adaptive coding scheme for low latency communication. They aimed at reducing both random and burst erasures by coding in a higher order field, namely GF(256). Since, their work was focused on streaming applications they could afford coding in such high order fields, but in our resource constrained use case coding in such higher order fields would drastically increase the computational complexity, which would make the sensors power hungry and energy inefficient. Some of the above mentioned problems were addressed in \cite{DaRe}, where they design a coding scheme for LoRaWAN which provides better packet reception and reliability against burst and random errors. The system is designed in complete absence of feedback, which proves to be a vital resource if used efficiently.

The authors of \cite{borkotokyicc} introduce two coding schemes---\textit{Windowed Coding and Selective Coding} for our use cases. Both of the schemes make use of available intermittent feedback along with a unique packet structure and coding scheme. They intelligently decide when to code and how many symbols are to be coded. They also provide steps to perform when feedback is unavailable. This current work is heavily based on the \textit{Windowed Coding} scheme making modifications to it to remove the implicit shortcomings of that approach. The \textit{Windowed Coding} scheme is described in detail in Chapter 2.

\section{Channel Models}
\label{ChannelModels}
\rhead{Channel Models}
A number of mathematical models are currently available which emulate how a communication channel will perform under certain conditions. In this particular section we describe the various channel models that have been used throughout this study namely the Bernouli and Gilbert-Elliot channel models.

\subsection{Bernouli Channel}

A Bernouli channel is the simplest of all channel models where each packet transmission is independent of the other. This is a channel erasure model where a packet transmitted can either be successfully received or can be lost while transmission but it cannot get corrupted (It is assumed that certain channel coding protocols have been used which ensure error free delivery or error correction capabilities if errors do happen). This type of channel can be characterized by the probability of correct reception or success, which indicates that if a packet is transmitted from the sender with what probability it will be successfully received by the receiver. Transmission through the channel is usually modelled by generating a random number in $[0, 1]$ and if this number is less than the channel success probability the packet transmission is successful.

\end{figure*}


\subsection{Gilbert-Elliot Channel}

A Gilbert-Elliot Channel model is a two state Markov process which is used to model correlated erasures that might happen in a wireless channel. Such erasures may happen when there is a temporary obstacle between the source and receiver leading to some successive transmissions being lost. The Markov process has two states - good and bad. A packet transmitted during the good state is received correctly and is lost if transmitted during the bad state. The states may change from one to another based on the state transition probabilities - $p_{bg}$, probability of bad state to go into good state; and $p_{gb}$, probability of good state to go in bad state.

\begin{equation}
	P_{ss} = \begin{bmatrix} p_{gg} & p_{gb} \\ p_{bg} & p_{bb}\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 - p_{gb} & p_{gb} \\ p_{bg} & 1 - p_{bg}\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}


\section{Summary}

In this chapter, we discussed the basics of application layer, the previous works and basic channel models which we would be using throughout our work. In the succeeding chapter we will describe the \textit{Windowed Coding} scheme from \cite{borkotokyicc} which forms the backbone of our work.
