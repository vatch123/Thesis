# Applcation Layer Coding for Delay, Duty-Cycle and Feedback Constrained Sensor Networks

This repository contains the Latex scripts for my undergrad thesis at Indian Institute of Technology Bhubaneswar under the guidance of Dr. Siddhartha S. Borkotoky. The work describes novel algorithms for application layer coding to increase the reliablility in a wireless sensor network.

The `src` folder contains the source files and the `pdfs` folder have the finished reports.
