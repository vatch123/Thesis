Application layer in a communication network is an abstraction layer that provides a set of shared protocols and interfaces between various hosts for information transfer. It is the topmost layer in various communication models like TCP/IP and OSI and masks the underlying mechanisms and allow for communication between various applications in different hosts. Application-layer coding has been shown to be an effective means to increase network reliability via transmission of redundancy to compensate for random packet losses in the network. In this work, we develop a low-complexity application-layer coding scheme suitable for delay-constrained communications with intermittently available receiver feedback. Such a scheme could be widely used for control operations in wireless sensor networks where a number of sensors transmit data to a common gateway for analysis and decision making purposes.
