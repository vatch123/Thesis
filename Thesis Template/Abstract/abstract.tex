Application layer in a communication network is an abstraction layer that provides a set of shared protocols and interfaces between various hosts for information transfer. It is the topmost layer in various communication models like TCP/IP and OSI and masks the underlying mechanisms and allow for communication between various applications in different hosts. Application layer codes ensure that the communication between hosts is reliable with minimum number of data packets lost in transmission. In this work we present a application layer coding scheme which utilizes intermittent feedback and can be used for delay and energy constraint applications. Such a scheme could be widely used for control operations in wireless sensor networks where a number of sensors transmit data to a common gateway for analysis and decision making purposes.
